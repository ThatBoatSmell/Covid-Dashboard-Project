This dashboard has been created by members of Codeclan's DR20
Professional Data Analysis Cohort.

The purpose of the dashboard is to enable users to explore data relating
to the provision of acute healthcare in Scotland. Although split into
various sections, the same 3x Key Performance Indicators have been
utilised throughout.

**1. Number of Hospital Admissions**

Metric: Number of Episodes

Definition: *An admission marks the start of an inpatient episode or day
case episode. (The National Data Catalogue, Data Dictionary)*

**2. Average Length of Hospital Stay**

Metric: Length of Stay OR Avg. Length of Stay

Definition: *Length of stay is the length of an inpatient episode. (The
National Data Catalogue, Data Dictionary)*

**3. Percentage of Bed Occupancy**

Metric: Percentage of Bed Occupancy

Definition: *An occupied bed is an available staffed bed which is either
being used to accommodate an inpatient or reserved for a patient on
pass. (The National Data Catalogue, Data Dictionary)*

**Data Quality**

All data has been sourced from Public Health Scotland (www.opendata.nhs.scot) and data used ranges from 2017Q3 to 2022Q3.

All efforts have been made to ensure that the dashboard utilises as much of the available data as possible. For the metrics below however, complete data was not always available and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting results.

- Percentage of Bed Occupancy
- Length of Stay
- Year/Quarter (Only data for 2017Q3 - 2022Q3 Available).
